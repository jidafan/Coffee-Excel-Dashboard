## Introduction

This project aims to create a dashboard showing the sales data of a coffee shop from 2019 - 2022. The dashboard will show the total sales over time, include sales by country and showcase the top 5 customers. There will also be filters and a timeline for users to interact with.

## Data Review

The data spreadsheet contains three sheets: orders, customers, and products. Orders contain general information on the purchase, customers contain identifying information about the purchaser, and products outline the details of what was sold. The file contains sales data from January 2019 to August 2022. 

## Excel Dashboard

### Data Exploration

The first step conducted in this project was to gather data from all respective sheets and populate the orders sheet. To do this commands such as XLOOUP and INDEX were used to grab information from the customers and products sheet. If statements were used as well to expand on columns with abbreviations. After gathering the data, the orders sheet was converted into a table.

### Pivot Table

After transforming the data, a pivot table was created from the spreadsheet. From this table, pivot charts were created and slicers to visually display and filter the data.

### Dashboard

The dashboard contains a timeline for users to be able to specify the time range of the data they wish to observe. There are also filters using slicers to edit the information further.
